My main areas of interest are programming languages, parallel computing, and algorithms. In my research, I aim to raise the level of abstraction at which computer scientists reason about problems, and develop algorithms and software. To this end, I develop abstractions and design the supporting language constructs, algorithms, and software systems.

My research goal is to improve the quality and security of software and the productivity of engineers by providing novel ways to express and enforce structural and behavioral aspects of software design within source code, typically through language design and type systems. I both prove formal properties of the systems I develop, and also evaluate their practical benefits via case studies, human subjects experiments, and corpus studies with open source codebases.
I am a faculty member in Electrical & Computer Engineering, affiliated with the Computer Science Department, and a core member of the Parallel Data Lab. My students' research has been added to the Linux kernel, helped scientists run scientific simulations in one of the largest supercomputers in the world, has been featured in the Morning Paper, HackerNews, Wired, etc. Accolades we received include two R&D100 awards, a MLSys outstanding paper award, a IEEE/ACM Supercomputing best paper finalist award, and a ACM SIGMETRICS best paper award. I love hiking, biking, baking, analyzing all types of data, playing video games, and being a general handyperson.

My main research interest is in the interaction between algorithms and languages, mostly in the context of parallel computing, and has consisted of both theoretical and experimental work. As programming languages become higher level, implementations become more complex, and parallelism becomes pervasive, users are naturally becoming more removed from the hardware and its costs. Rather than trying to bring programmers down to the level of the machine to understand and get good performance, however, I believe that we should be trying to bring languages and cost models up to the level of the programmer. My research therefore centers around questions of how to model costs (e.g. time and space) for very-high level programming constructs (e.g. dynamic parallelism, futures, garbage collection), of how to design systems so these costs have meaning, and of how to make use of these features in effective algorithms design.

Stephen Brookes is well known internationally for his seminal contributions to semantics for concurrent programs and logics for reasoning about program behaviour. He earned both his bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and his Ph. D. in Computer Science at Oxford University, joined Carnegie Mellon University as a research computer scientist in 1981, and has been a full professor there since 2006. His doctoral dissertation, supervised by Tony Hoare, was titled "A Model for Communicating Sequential Processes".
My primary research area is software security techniques that give users guarantees. My research is at the intersection of model checking, formal methods, compilers, and logic, all of which are applied to security problems.  Some of the central techniques that we are developing in order to accomplish our goals include efficient symbolic execution, reasoning about bit-level arithmetic in finite fields, sound decompilation, and decision procedures.  I also work in other areas of computer security, such as network security and applied cryptography. In these areas, we look at efficient protocols, efficient signature schemes, and privacy-preserving cryptography.

I am interested in making robots act purposefully and successfully in a world in which most everything is uncertain.  Sensors are noisy, actions are imprecise, and models are faulty. I wish to understand how these uncertainties interact and how to overcome them. My research draws on tools from geometry, mechanics, planning, probability, and topology. Most recently I have explored topological methods for planning and control. Topology allows a system to abstract connectivity properties, filtering out the imprecision caused by uncertainty. For instance, one recent novel topological result is a graph controllability theorem:
There are two main focus areas: graph mining and stream mining. In the first, the goal is to find patterns in large graphs, so that we can spot anomalies, communities, patterns and regularities. Graphs appear in many instances: as document-term bipartitegraphs in Information retrieval, as web pages or blogs linking to each other, as customer-product recommendations, as protein-protein regulatory networks, as computer-network traffic, and many more. Our emphasis is on scalability, so that we can handle graphs withthousands and millions of nodes. Research directions include time-evolving graphs, where we have beenusing 'tensors' to find patterns, as well as graphs where the nodes and/or the edges have attributes.

My work seeks to design high-performance systems for computer graphics and visual computing. Due to the compute-intensive nature of computer graphics applications, graphics systems must operate at exceptional levels of efficiency. To enable the development of new, complex applications, these high-performance systems must also be practical to program and use. To meet both these challenges, my students design new parallel graphics architectures (GPUs), develop parallel algorithms for rendering and simulation, and develop new programming models and compiler technologies that make it easier to express and optimize graphics computations.

I have broad research interests in computer systems, including cloud computing, storage/file systems, operating systems and distributed systems. I am involved in several ongoing projects in such areas as systems for large-scale ML, cloud/cluster resource scheduling, and exploitation of new storage/NVM technologies.
My field of interest is software engineering, and specifically the areas of software architecture, self-adaptive systems, and cyber-physical systems. The common thread that links these areas is the problem of controlling the complexity of large software systems by providing a scientific basis for software design and analysis.

My broad research interests center on ensembles, systems that contain massive numbers of interacting components. My goal is to understand, design, and build robust and useful systems that can scale towards millions, billions, or even Moles of components. While my main emphasis is on manufactured artifacts, I am also interested in the economy, i.e., a massively distributed system of people. In the area of reconfigurable computing (in the context of the PipeRench and Phoenix projects) we investigated how to compile high-level programming languages directly into configurations that could harness the large ensemble of gates for computing. He then began investigating how ensembles of molecules could be used to create circuits; investigating how to design, manufacture, and use molecular-scale devices for computing. This led to the Claytronics project, research into programmable matter; an ensemble of computing elements that can be programmed to work together to produce changes in the physical properties of the ensemble.

Looking for mathematically strong student who likes to prove theorems and enjoys learning new math techniques.
The goal of my research is to develop a comprehensive theory of programming that integrates with the practice of software development.  The premise of my research is that programming is an explanatory activity, a form of expression intended to convey an idea that is both comprehensible by other people and executable by a computer.  Language therefore plays a central role in programming.  The overall goal of my work is to develop a language for computation that serves both purposes.
My research focuses on solving hard problems automatically with having high confidence in the results. 
While humans are great at many aspects of problem  solving, we are no match for computers in a range of ways,  
including precise logical reasoning. Such reasoning is crucial in industry and academia, for 
instance to ensure that computer systems work exactly as intended, in fields ranging from health care to finance to aviation. 
The main themes of my research are described below.
Dr. Hodgins's research focuses on the coordination and control of dynamic physical systems, both natural and human-made and explores techniques that may someday allow robots and animated creatures to plan and control their actions in complex and unpredictable environments. Her current research focuses on generating motion for computer animation by using motion capture data in combination with physically realistic simulation. Hodgins and her students have used dynamic simulation to animate human behaviors such as running, bicycling, diving, and vaulting. She and her colleagues have also used human motion data to bias planning algorithms towards more natural postures, to construct interfaces for avatars, and to capture the motion of muscles and skin. Hodgins is now refining some of these techniques for the control of a humanoid robot. Hodgins and her students have also explored passive simulations for animating phenomena such as clothing, water, breaking objects, and explosions.
My research mission is to discover beautiful mathematical ideas that have a real-world impact, shape the way programmers think, and help to create software that is more reliable, efficient, and secure.

My main interest is in sequential and parallel algorithm design. Of particular interest are problems that arise in scientific computation and image processing. We have been working on three classes of problems. Our work is both more theoretical yet more practical since we require two important properties of our algorithms: they should be both be fast and have strong guarantees of quality, size, and speed.

I am interested in many areas of computer science, but especially in how to construct computers that learn from experience.  At the heart of the problem of machine learning is the question of how to automatically formulate general hypotheses given a collection of very specific training examples. My research has addressed a number of approaches to this question, including statistical approaches that find regularities over large numbers of training examples, and analytical approaches that generalize from very few examples and rely instead on prior knowledge and reasoning.

                                        Dynamic Logic of Communicating Hybrid Programs

,
The goal of my research is to dramatically boost the performance of future microprocessor-based systems. To accomplish this, we exploit various forms of parallelism through a combination of novel architectural, compiler and operating systems support. In particular, we have been focusing on the opportunities and challenges created by two important VLSI technology trends which are expected to reshape computer systems over the next decade: the potential for single-chip multiprocessing due to higher levels of single-chip integration, and the need to tolerate off-chip latency as the gap between processor speed and the speed of memory and I/O continues to widen.

I work in the area of computer systems. My interests within computer systems are quite broad, including online education, cloud computing, and scientific computing. My main interest these days is the phenomena surrounding autograding, that is, programs evaluating other programs.
I am an Assistant Professor with the Robotics Institute and Computer Science Department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests span many topics across computer graphics and computer vision, but I’m particularly interested in computational imaging: a field that combines optics, electronics, and computational processing to capture or display new forms of visual information.

At the heart of my research lies the desire to understand the principles of programming languages. Programming languages are the key to the programming process and therefore of fundamental importance to computer science. Well-designed programming languages allow fast program development, ease software maintenance, and increase confidence in the correctness of implementations. Poorly designed programming languages lead to verbose and impenetrable programs that are difficult to debug and maintain. One of the trends in computer science has been the development of a plethora of languages, often for very specific purposes. Unfortunately, many of these languages are woefully misdesigned, because their developers were unaware of or have disregarded basic principles of programming language design. My research thus aims at discovering such principles and experimenting with them through implementations and environments.

My main research interests are in artificial intelligence, electronic commerce, game theory, multiagent systems, automated negotiation, contracting, auctions, exchanges, coalition formation, voting, algorithmic mechanism design, and normative models of bounded rationality. A key goal of this research is to construct electronic marketplaces that are efficient both in terms of the resulting economic allocations and the computational processes. We approach this by developing incentive-compatible market mechanisms and the algorithms that execute those mechanisms efficiently, as well as by designing software agents that act optimally on behalf of the real-world parties that they represent in such markets. A central subject of this research is the deep interaction between the game-theoretic incentive issues and the computational issues that stem from computational limits on the mechanism and the agents. Our research involves theoretical work such as models of limited computation, mechanism design, equilibrium analysis, and algorithm design as well as computational experiments and system building. Many of our systems have been commercially fielded.

For their joint paper "Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem", which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept. Their classic paper has been a continuous source of inspiration for subsequent work in this field.
Today, we see an explosion of Internet-enabled devices, applications, and services. In conjunction, we also observe increasing performance (e.g., network latency, application-perceived quality of experience) and security expectations from users and applications. These requirements have historically outpaced innovation in networking and network security. This creates significant stresses on the network infrastructure, and leads to suboptimal and insecure end-to-end systems. The overarching vision of my research is to provide practical-yet-rigorous solutions that enable network infrastructures to keep up with (and exceed) the evolving performance and security requirements of the applications they enable.
My primary interests are in the broad areas of network protocols and distributed network applications. In the past, I have worked on topics such as transport/routing protocol interactions with wireless networks, sensor networking, fast protocol stack implementations, RAID system design, performance prediction for Internet transfers, firewall design, and improvements to the TCP protocol. The following two projects are examples of my current research efforts.
Nihar's research broadly lies in the areas of statistical learning, game theory, and information theory, with a focus on problems in crowdsourcing and learning from people.
Software now accounts for the lion's share of the cost of developing and using computer systems. My long-term goal is to establish a genuine engineering discipline to support the design and development of software systems, in particular systems used by real people. Currently I'm working on design methods and analytic techniques for building complete software systems out of subsystems and their constituent modules. This is the software architecture level of design.

I design and build systems that are efficient, provably secure, and friendly to users and programmers. To this end, I take an interdisciplinary approach that blends cryptography, systems security, and language-based security.
My research focuses on the area reliable autonomous systems (especially mobile robots) operating in rich, uncertain environments. The goal is to create intelligent systems that can operate autonomously for long periods of time in unstructured, natural environments. This necessitates robots that can plan, reason about uncertainty, diagnose and recover from unanticipated errors, interact with other robots and humans, and learn. I am interested in the use of probabilistic reasoning to explicitly model and plan for uncertainty.  I am currently focusing on multi-robot coordination and human-robot social interaction. Multi-Robot Coordination. We are researching issues of how multiple, heterogeneous robots can coordinate to carry out high-level tasks, especially those that cannot be accomplished by a single robot. Issues include having the robots negotiate to dynamically form teams and assign tasks, monitoring each other's performance, and adapting dynamically to changing situations. The work extends traditional three-tiered architectures to multiple robots and extends planning and scheduling algorithms to handle uncertainty and failing plans. Application domains include dexterous, multi-robot large-scale assembly. Human-Robot Social Interaction. The goal here is to make robots more useful and acceptable by enabling them to interact with humans using social rules and conventions. This includes both conversational and spatial social interaction.  In the area of conversational interaction, we have developed the roboceptionist, in conjunction with the School of Drama, to have a robot with character and personality interact over long periods of time.  In the area of spatial interaction, we are looking at socially appropriate navigation and rhythmic interaction.  We are also interested in culturally appropriate interaction. Probabilistic Reasoning in Robotics. We are exploring the use of probabilistic reasoning techniques in controlling autonomous robots. We are investigating methods for making mobile robots more robust and self-reliant, especially using Markov models and partially observable Markov models.
